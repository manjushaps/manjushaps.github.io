# üìÉ Introduction
To build a clean, fast, and code-friendly blog or portfolio, **Jekyll** is one of the most versatile tools you can use. As a powerful, Ruby-based static site generator, Jekyll seamlessly integrates with GitHub Pages, allowing you to transform plain text files‚Äîwritten in Markdown or Liquid templates‚Äîinto fully functional websites without the complexity of databases or server-side scripting.

However, to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow, it‚Äôs crucial to set up your local Jekyll environment correctly‚Äîespecially on Windows, where a few additional steps are necessary. This guide will walk you through the complete setup process, providing clear instructions and troubleshooting tips to help you get Jekyll running flawlessly on your Windows system.

# üìë System Requirements and Prerequisites
Before setting up Jekyll on Windows, let‚Äôs make sure your system is prepared with the right tools and environment. This will ensure a smooth installation experience.

## üíª Minimum System Requirements
- *Operating System* - Windows 10 or 11 (64 bit preferred)
- *Admin Access* - To install system-level tools
- *Basic Terminal Familarity* - A little command line experience

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You'll Need

| **Tool**      | **Purpose**                      | **Official Site**                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Git           | Version control, terminal access | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)             |
| Ruby (DevKit) | Needed to run Jekyll             | [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org) |
| Bundler       | Manages Ruby gems                | Comes with Ruby or via `gem install`           |
| Jekyll        | Static site generator            | Installed via RubyGems                         |

> **Tip - Git Bash or Command Prompt can be used for setup. Pick whichever you're more comfortable with**

## üí≠ Environment Used For This Guide
> To ensure a clean and reproducible setup process, I used **Windows Sandbox** ‚Äî a secure, disposable virtual environment available in Windows 10/11 Pro‚Äîfor testing and capturing screenshots during installation.
> 
> This allowed me to document each step from a fresh state without interfering with my main system.
>
> However, you can follow all the steps below directly on your regular Windows system. Using Windows Sandbox is completely optional and only used here for demonstration purposes.

## Ruby + DevKit Installation
- Download **Ruby + DevKit(x64)** from **https://rubyinstaller.org**
  - When installing Ruby on Windows, choosing the version with **DevKit (Development Kit)** is essential.
  - **DevKit** is a set of tools that allow Ruby to build and use gems (libraries) with native extensions (written in C/C++). This is especially important for tools like Jekyll, which rely on such gems.This DevKit is required for Windows but not for macOS or Linux.

1. **Run Ruby + DevKit installer**
- Run the downloaded .exe file to start the installation.
- This is the welcome screen of ruby

2. **Installation Options and DevKit Setup**
- Make sure to check ‚ÄúAdd Ruby to PATH‚Äù ‚Äî this is essential for using Ruby from the command line.
- Choose the recommended installation directory for smooth setup.
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Ruby_exec_path.png" alt="exec path" width="500" height="auto">
- Check the option to run **ridk install**, which will open a terminal
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Run_ridk_install.png" alt="terminal1" width="500" height="auto">
- Running **ridk install** - Two-Step Process
  - After installation, you will be prompted with three options for setting up MSYS2.
  - Choose Option 3: **MSYS2 and MINGW development toolchain**.
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Ruby_installer_terminal.png" alt="terminal1" width="500" height="auto">
  - A second set of options will appear.
  - If unsure, press ENTER to continue with the recommended setup.
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Ruby_install_final.png" alt="terminal2" width="500" height="auto">
  - This completes the setup of MSYS2 and the MINGW toolchain.

3. **Verify Ruby Installation**
