# üìÑ Introduction

**Rust is happy to let you share your data‚Ä¶ but only if you follow its strict borrowing etiquette. Break the rules, and the borrow checker will step in**.

In our **[previous post on Ownership](https://manjushaps.github.io/Rust-Series-Ownership/)**, we learned that every piece of data in Rust has exactly one owner ‚Äî and once ownership moves, the old owner can‚Äôt use it anymore. But what if you just want to use someone else‚Äôs data without taking it away from them?

That‚Äôs where **borrowing** comes in. It‚Äôs like asking to borrow a friend‚Äôs pen: you can write with it, you might even carry it around for a while, but you must give it back exactly as you found it. Rust ensures this borrowing happens safely by preventing three common issues:

- **Accidental overwrites** ‚Äî when multiple places try to modify the same data at once.
- **Dangling references** ‚Äî when a reference points to memory that‚Äôs already gone.
- **Memory leaks** ‚Äî when memory is never freed after use.

In the next sections, we‚Äôll see what borrowing is, why it matters, and how to handle common borrowing errors with confidence.

## üìå What is Borrowing?
Borrowing is Rust‚Äôs way of allowing temporary access to data without taking ownership of it. When you borrow a value, you use it through a reference, and when you‚Äôre done, the original owner still retains full control.

References are created using the **`&`** symbol for **immutable borrows** or **`&mut`** for **mutable borrows**:

```rust
let name = String::from("Rust");
let ref_to_name = &name; // borrowing 'name' immutably
```
> Think of it like borrowing a friend‚Äôs pen ‚Äî you can use it, but you must return it in the same condition. In programming terms, this means you can read or even modify the data (with rules), but you cannot take it away or destroy it.

Borrowing ensures:
- No two places can write to the same data at once.
- No place can read data that no longer exists.

With these safety rules in mind, let‚Äôs look at why we need borrowing and how it works in practice‚Ä¶

---

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why We Use Borrowing in Rust?
Just like borrowing a friend‚Äôs pen saves you from buying a new one, borrowing in Rust lets you work with data without making unnecessary copies or giving up control of it.

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important:
- **Avoid unnecessary data copying** ‚Äì Borrowing lets you pass data to functions without making expensive clones *(e.g., passing a large vector to a print function)*.
- **Enable shared access** ‚Äì Multiple parts of your program can read the same data without conflict *(e.g., two different modules displaying the same configuration)*.
- **Control modifications** ‚Äì Mutable borrows allow changes, but in a controlled way that prevents race conditions *(e.g., updating a score while no one else is reading it)*.
- **Preserve the owner‚Äôs control** ‚Äì The original owner still decides when the value is dropped *(e.g., memory for a string is freed when its owner goes out of scope)*.

Borrowing is one of Rust‚Äôs core safety tools, making it possible to work with complex data flows without losing track of who‚Äôs responsible for what. Now that we know why it‚Äôs important, let‚Äôs look into the **two types of borrowing** and see them in action.

## üóÇÔ∏è Types of Borrowing in Rust
###  ‚ö†Ô∏è Immutable Borrow **(`&`)**
An immutable borrow is like looking at your friend‚Äôs notebook without making any marks ‚Äî you can see everything but can‚Äôt change any thing. In Rust, you can have multiple immutable borrows to the same data at the same time.

Let's understand immutable borrow with an example

```rust
fn main() {
    let city = String::from("Tokyo");
    print_length(&city); // pass immutable reference
    println!("City is still accessible: {}", city);
}

fn print_length(name: &String) {
    println!("Length is: {}", name.len());
}
```

***Explanation:***

| **Line**                                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `let city = String::from("Tokyo");`      | Creates a `String` and assigns ownership to `city`.                                                                                                     |
| `print_length(&city);`                   | Passes an immutable reference of `city` to `print_length`. The function can **read** the value but **cannot change it**. Ownership remains with `city`. |
| `fn print_length(name: &String)`         | Declares a function with the parameter `name`, which is a **reference to a `String`**.                                                                  |
| `println!("Length is: {}", name.len());` | Prints the length of the string. After the function call, `city` is still fully accessible because ownership was not transferred.                       |

<div class="try-box">
  <p><strong>üí° Try it yourself:</strong> <br>
    Replace "Tokyo" with any other city name and run the program ‚Äî you‚Äôll see the borrow works the same way.</p>
</div>

But sometimes, you don‚Äôt just want to look at the data ‚Äî you want to change it. That‚Äôs where **mutable borrowing** comes in.

### üìù Mutable Borrow **(`&mut`)**
A mutable borrow is like asking your friend, ‚ÄúCan I use your notebook to add a few notes?‚Äù ‚Äî you‚Äôre allowed to read and modify, but the rule is strict: only one mutable borrow can exist at a time, and it can‚Äôt coexist with immutable borrows.

Let's understand mutable borrow with an example

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut score = 50;
    update_score(&mut score); // pass mutable reference
    println!("Updated score: {}", score);
}

fn update_score(value: &mut i32) {
    *value += 10;
}
```

***Explanation:***

| **Line**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `let mut score = 50;`              | Creates a mutable variable `score` with the value `50`.                                                                                                                      |
| `update_score(&mut score);`        | Passes a mutable reference of `score` to `update_score`. This allows the function to modify the original variable without taking ownership.                                  |
| `fn update_score(value: &mut i32)` | Declares a function with the parameter `value`, which is a **mutable reference** to an `i32`. The expression `*value` dereferences it, and `*value += 10;` updates it by 10. |
| After the function call            | `score` now holds `60` because the modification was applied directly through the mutable reference.                                                                          |

###  üì¶ Borrowing Rule Recap
To keep your borrows safe, Rust enforces these rules:

- **Any number** of **immutable borrows (&T)** at a time.
- **Only one mutable borrow (&mut T)** at a time.
- No mixing mutable and immutable borrows to the same data at the same time.
- A borrow must never outlive the data it refers to.

## üîñ Ownership Vs Borrowing

| **Feature**                         | **Ownership**                         | **Borrowing**                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who controls the value?**         | The owner variable                    | The owner still controls it; borrower has temporary access     |
| **How long can you use it?**        | Until it goes out of scope            | Until the borrow ends (function return, block end, etc.)       |
| **Does control move?**              | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå No ‚Äì access is temporary                                    |
| **Can you modify it?**              | ‚úÖ Yes, if it‚Äôs mutable               | ‚úÖ Yes, only with a mutable borrow (`&mut`)                    |
| **Number of simultaneous accesses** | One owner at a time                   | Many immutable borrows **or** one mutable borrow               |
| **When is memory freed?**           | When the owner goes out of scope      | When the owner goes out of scope (borrowers don‚Äôt free memory) |
| **Example**                         | Moving a string into another variable | Passing a reference to a function without cloning              |

## üîç Borrowing Errors & How to Fix Them
Rust‚Äôs borrow checker is like a strict librarian ‚Äî it makes sure you return books on time, don‚Äôt scribble on someone else‚Äôs notes without permission, and never try to read a book that‚Äôs been thrown away. If you break the borrowing rules, Rust will stop compilation and show you an error.

Here are some common borrowing errors and how to fix them:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mutable and Immutable Borrow Conflict

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut name = String::from("Rustacean");
    let r1 = &name;        // immutable borrow
    let r2 = &mut name;    // mutable borrow in same scope
    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

***Error Message Screenshot:***
<div style="text-align: center;">

  <img src="/assets/images/borrow_error1.png" alt="error1" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

**Why it happens :** <br>
You can have multiple immutable borrows or one mutable borrow, but not both at the same time.

**How to fix:** <br>
Use immutable borrows first, then create the mutable borrow after they‚Äôre done being used.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut name = String::from("Rustacean");
    {
        let r1 = &name;
        println!("{}", r1); // immutable borrow ends here
    }
    let r2 = &mut name;
    println!("{}", r2);
}
```

<div class="try-box">
  <p><strong>üí° Try it yourself:</strong> <br>
    - Run the first code snippet to see the borrow checker error in your terminal. <br>
    - Then run the fixed version and verify that it compiles and prints the expected output. <br>
    - <strong> Challenge :</strong> Can you restructure the code so both borrows are valid without changing the printed values?</p>
</div>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Borrow Outliving Its Data (Dangling Reference)

```rust
fn main() {
    let r;
    {
        let s = String::from("Rust");
        r = &s; // `s` will be dropped at the end of this block
    }
    println!("{}", r); // ERROR
}
```

***Error Message Screenshot:***
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/images/borrow_error2.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/images/borrow_error2.png" alt="error2" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

**Why it happens:** <br>
`r` points to data (s) that no longer exists once the inner block ends.

**How to fix:** <br>
Return the owned value instead of a reference.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Rust");
    let r = &s;
    println!("{}", r);
}
```

<div class="try-box">
  <p><strong>üí° Try it yourself:</strong> <br>
    - Run the error version to see the lifetime error in the terminal.<br>
    - Then run the fixed version and check that it works.<br>
    - <strong>Challenge :</strong> Write your own dangling reference example and fix it.</p>
</div>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple Mutable Borrows

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num = 10;
    let r1 = &mut num;
    let r2 = &mut num; // ERROR: second mutable borrow
    println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
}
```

***Error Message Screenshot:***
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="/assets/images/borrow_error3.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/assets/images/borrow_error3.png" alt="error3" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

**Why it happens:** <br>
Only one mutable borrow is allowed in a given scope to prevent data races.

**How to fix:** <br>
We can solve this by making sure each mutable borrow is used and dropped before creating another one.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num = 10;
    {
        let r1 = &mut num;
        *r1 += 5;
    }
    let r2 = &mut num;
    *r2 += 10;
    println!("{}", num);
}
```

<div class="try-box">
  <p><strong>üí° Try it yourself:</strong> <br>
    - Run the error version to see the ‚Äúalready borrowed‚Äù message in your terminal.<br>
    - Then run the fixed version and confirm it compiles and updates the value as expected.<br>
    - <strong>Challenge :</strong> Modify the code so both updates happen in separate functions while still following borrow rules.</p>
</div>

## üìù Try it Yourself! - Example
Here is a simple example that helps you to understand borrowing in rust

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut student_name = String::from("Manjusha");

    // Immutable borrow - viewing student name
    display_name(&student_name);

    // Mutable borrow - updating student name
    update_name(&mut student_name);

    println!("Final student record: {student_name}");
}

fn display_name(name: &String) {
    println!("Viewing student record: {name}");
}

fn update_name(name: &mut String) {
    name.push_str(" (Class Representative)");
    println!("Student record updated!");
}
```
<div class="try-box">
  <p><strong>üí° Try it yourself:</strong> <br>
  - Change the <strong>display_name(&student_name)</strong> call to <strong>display_name(&mut student_name)</strong>. <em>Will this throw an error or still display the output?</em><br>
  - Move the <strong>display_name</strong> call after <strong>update_name</strong> and check if it still works.
  </p>
</div>

# üéØ Conclusion
Borrowing is Rust‚Äôs way of letting you use data without taking ownership, ensuring safe and efficient memory management. Whether you borrow immutably or mutably, the rules are simple but powerful ‚Äî follow them, and you avoid many pitfalls common in other languages.

Borrowing and ownership together form the backbone of Rust‚Äôs memory safety guarantees. But there‚Äôs one more piece of the puzzle: **lifetimes** ‚Äî they decide how long your borrows can live and ensure they‚Äôre always valid.
