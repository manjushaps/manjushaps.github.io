# üìÑ Introduction
**Back to Code ‚Äì Let‚Äôs Deploy Our Jekyll Site with Netlify!**
After reflecting with Marcus Aurelius, it‚Äôs time to get hands-on again ‚Äî this time with a clean Netlify deployment guide for all tech tinkerers and self-learners.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore how to deploy a Jekyll blog site to **Netlify**, using the **Liveblog** project as our demo.

So far on **Techn0tz**, we‚Äôve covered how to create a local Jekyll site and push it to GitHub Pages. Now, let‚Äôs take it a step further and host it on **Netlify** ‚Äî a powerful platform that makes static site deployment incredibly smooth.

> Now that your site is live locally and on GitHub, you might be wondering ‚Äî is there a more flexible, beginner-friendly way to host it?
> 
> That‚Äôs where Netlify shines ‚Äî let‚Äôs explore why it‚Äôs a great choice beyond GitHub Pages.

## üîé What is Netlify?
**Netlify** is a modern platform for deploying static websites. It connects to your GitHub repo, builds your project using simple commands like **bundle exec jekyll build**, and deploys it globally ‚Äî with HTTPS and custom domain support baked in.

It‚Äôs widely used in modern **JAMstack workflows** and is ideal for blogs, portfolios, and even full-blown static web applications.

**JAMstack** stands for **JavaScript, APIs, and Markup** ‚Äî a modern architecture where tools like Jekyll generate static content, and platforms like Netlify serve it with speed, scalability, and built-in automation.

With Netlify, you skip complex hosting setups. Instead, your blog builds itself automatically with every Git push ‚Äî freeing you to focus on writing and design.

> Think of Netlify as a smart deployment butler ‚Äî it handles builds, serves your content lightning-fast, adds HTTPS, and offers custom domains ‚Äî all with a few clicks.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll see when you land on Netlify ‚Äî clean UI, clear deploy options, and integrations at your fingertips.

# üìë GitHub Pages vs Netlify: Which One Should You Use?

Before we dive into the steps, here‚Äôs a quick side-by-side comparison to help you decide which platform suits your needs best.

| **Feature**                   | **GitHub Pages**                                        | **Netlify**                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup Simplicity**          | Requires configuring GitHub repo and Jekyll manually    | One-click deploy from GitHub with build automation             |
| **Custom Domain Support**     | Supported, but DNS setup is manual                      | Supports custom domains with guided DNS + free SSL            |
| **Build Automation**          | Limited to Jekyll (uses GitHub Actions or manual setup) | Full CI/CD pipeline built-in                                    |
| **HTTPS / SSL**               | Supported (via Let's Encrypt)                           | Free HTTPS with automatic renewal                               |
| **Speed & CDN**               | Hosted on GitHub‚Äôs infrastructure                       | Served through a global CDN for blazing fast loading        |
| **Preview Deployments**       | Not available                                           | Automatic deploy previews for pull requests                    |
| **Form Handling & Functions** | Not available                                           | Built-in support for forms, serverless functions              |
| **User Interface**            | Minimal, repo-based                                     | Clean web dashboard for managing deployments                   |

> In short: **GitHub Pages** is simple and great for pure Jekyll blogs. But **Netlify** adds automation, speed, HTTPS, and deployment magic ‚Äî making it a favourite for modern static sites.

# üìù Step-by-Step: Deploy Your Jekyll Blog to Netlify
We'll deploy the **Liveblog** project using Netlify, starting from your GitHub repository and ending with a live website ‚Äî complete with a custom domain setup preview.

## Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository and Jekyll Site
Before you can deploy your Jekyll blog to Netlify, make sure everything is working as expected:
 - You‚Äôve created a Jekyll site (e.g., Liveblog)
 - It runs successfully on your local machine with: **`bundle exec jekyll serve`**
 - Optionally, run this to preview the generated files: **`bundle exec jekyll build`**
 - Your project is pushed to a public GitHub repository

**Important: You don‚Äôt need to include the _site/ folder in your GitHub repo ‚Äî Netlify will generate it during deployment. Just ensure your source files are committed (like _posts/, _layouts/, index.md, _config.yml, and Gemfile).**

**Need to see a complete Jekyll setup first?**  
Check out **[Jekyll Series: Part 4 - LiveBlog: A Practical Example]({{ site.baseurl}}/jekyll/2025/05/29/Jekyll-Series-Part-4) on Techn0tz** ‚Äî where we created and styled the same site you're about to deploy.

***Screenshot :*** Running **`bundle exec jekyll build`** creates the **`_site/`** folder that Netlify will deploy.

</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

***Screenshot***: Your Jekyll site running locally confirms it's working before deployment.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_local_host.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site_local_host.png" alt="localhost" width="500" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

***Screenshot :*** Ensure the correct files are pushed and ready for Netlify(no _site/).
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GH_repo_netlify.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GH_repo_netlify.png" alt="GHrepo" width="200" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

Once your GitHub repo is ready and your Jekyll site builds correctly, you're all set to move on to the actual Netlify deployment!

## Step 2: Connect Your GitHub Blog to Netlify
Now that your Jekyll site is ready and pushed to GitHub, it's time to deploy it on Netlify

</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

## Step 3: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)
If you want your blog to live at a personal domain like **www.yourname.com** instead of a Netlify-generated URL, you can connect your custom domain easily.<br>
- This step includes:
    - Updating your site name (Optional)
    - Adding a custom domain to Netlify
    - Updating your DNS records
    - Enabling HTTPS with Netlify‚Äôs free SSL certificate

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Update Your Site Name (Optional)
Before adding a custom domain, you can change the default Netlify site name for readability.

***Screenshot :*** Customize your Netlify site name for easier management.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rename_netlify_url.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rename_netlify_url.png" alt="renameurl" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

***Screenshot :*** Jekyll blog opened in browser with new Netlify URL.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_new_url.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_new_url.png" alt="blognew" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Your Custom Domain
Go to **Domain Management ‚Üí Add a domain.**

***Screenshot :*** Add a custom domain name to link your blog with your own domain.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add_existing_domain.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add_existing_domain.png" alt="existing" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

You can either connect an existing domain or buy one directly through Netlify.

***Screenshot :*** Buy a domain directly from Netlify if you don‚Äôt already own one.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/buy_new_domain.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/buy_new_domain.png" alt="new" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DNS Records
After connecting your domain, Netlify will provide DNS records that need to be updated with your domain registrar.

> For this demo, we‚Äôre using **blog.example.com** as a placeholder.

When setting up your own domain, be sure to replace it with your actual domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com or blog.yourdomain.com) in both the DNS settings and Netlify configuration.

***Screenshot :*** DNS settings from your domain provider to point to your Netlify site.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/DNS_fields.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/DNS_fields.png" alt="DNSfields" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

***Screenshot :*** Sample DNS records ‚Äî add these to your domain provider‚Äôs DNS panel.

</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

***Screenshot :*** HTML Version
If you want to manually enter these values, here‚Äôs a copyable version of the DNS table format:

<details>
<summary>Click to view HTML version</summary>

``` html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type</th><th>Name / Host</th><th>Value / Points to</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>CNAME</td><td>www</td><td>your-site-name.netlify.app</td></tr>
    <tr><td>A</td><td>@</td><td>75.2.60.5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>netlify-challenge</td><td>your-challenge-value</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
</details>

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Enable HTTPS (SSL Certificate)
Once DNS propagation is complete, Netlify enables HTTPS automatically.

***Screenshot :***  Netlify auto-enables free HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt after domain is verified.
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HTTP_SSL.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/HTTP_SSL.png" alt="HTTP" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>


> **A Note on This Demo Setup** 
>
> Since we're using a demo domain (**blog.example.com**), HTTPS activation and domain redirection aren't shown live. But once your real domain is connected and DNS is verified, Netlify will automatically enable HTTPS using Let‚Äôs Encrypt.

**üéâThat‚Äôs it! Your Jekyll blog is now live on a custom domain with secure HTTPS ‚Äî all thanks to Netlify‚Äôs powerful and beginner-friendly setup.**

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Common Deployment Errors
After deploying, you might run into some common issues like:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Styles not loading or broken layout**

***Why it happens:***<br>
Netlify uses your Jekyll site‚Äôs generated HTML from the _site/ folder. This usually happens when baseurl or url in _config.yml doesn‚Äôt match your Netlify domain, causing broken paths for CSS, JS, or images.

**Solution:**
Update your _config.yml:
```
url: "https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app"
baseurl: ""  # Leave blank if hosted at root
```

***Screenshot :*** Updating url and baseurl values to match Netlify site
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/netlify_config.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/netlify_config.png" alt="config" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Clicking internal links or refreshing gives a 404**

***Why it happens:***
Static sites like Jekyll don‚Äôt handle dynamic routing by default. Netlify needs a rule to tell it how to serve the site on refresh or direct link access.

**Solution:**
```
Add this file directly to the root of your Jekyll project (not inside _site/)

_redirects
/*    /index.html   200
```

***Screenshot :*** Netlify _redirects file to handle page reload and clean navigation
<div style="text-align: center;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/redirects_vsc.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/redirects_vsc.png" alt="redirects" width="400" />
</a>
<p><em>Click the image to view full size</em></p></div>

Once you commit and push these fixes to GitHub, Netlify will redeploy your site automatically. Within seconds, your styles and links should work as expected.

> Tip: You can always check your **Netlify deploy logs** from the dashboard to debug further ‚Äî they‚Äôre detailed and easy to follow.
